# 🧪 Networking Labs

Hands-on Cisco Packet Tracer networking labs covering VLANs, Inter-VLAN routing, Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS), Layer 3 switching, DHCP, static routing, and more.  
These labs demonstrate real-world networking fundamentals and are part of my learning path toward the CompTIA Network+ and CCNA certifications.
